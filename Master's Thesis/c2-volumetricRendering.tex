\chapter{Volumetric Rendering}

What is this chapter about? What does each section talk about?

\section{Volume Data}

Here, I want to make clear what exactly is being rendered in a volumetric rendering pipeline, and what makes it different to conventional rendering.

\section{Direct Volume Rendering}

Here, I want to give a quick overview of what is happening. Basically, I want to talk about how its mapping the intensity values contained within the dataset to colours and alpha values from the transfer function onto the image plane

\subsection{Direct Volume Rendering Methods}

Here, I'll go into how its all supposed to work at a low level, give a good amount of detail. I'll first talk about object order approaches, since I'll need to have readers well versed in the idea for when I describe my Compute Shader implementation. Then I'll chat about image order approaches, to help understand the raytracing aspect of the program.
